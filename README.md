The task was given to me as part of a term prject in my university. It was to create a program that must have inheritance and the following instructions:
There are two persons - teacher and student.
They both communicate in a form of a chat.
At the end when both persons type exit, the program exists and output the message archive in the terminal. The archive does not get stored in a txt.
